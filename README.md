Fast-Clipboard
==============

In one clic on the text wanted, it is in the clipboard. Then you only have to paste it.

Used, for example, for encoding configuration on the console of a router. It's boring to always type the same minimal configuration or to go to the folder, open the txt, select all and copy it...

I'll try to make it easier ! ^^

I'm making it in C++/Qt4.4 so it will run on all Qt4 supported platforms (Linux/OSX/Windows/...).
